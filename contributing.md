Guidelines for adding or editing glossary entries:

- **One term per row.**
- Fields required: `Term`, `Meaning`, `Spanish translation/adaptation`, `Application`, `Examples (max 2)`, `Synonyms`, `Common environments`.
- Be concise: 1–2 lines for Meaning, 1 line for Application, up to 2 examples.
- Use business language; avoid academic verbosity.

Steps:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add or update `docs/glossary.md` and `glossary.csv`.
3. Open a PR with description and tag `team/product-linguistics` and `team/security` if relevant.
